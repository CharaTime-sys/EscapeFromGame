F: So, are you sure these files are safe here?

<div class="line patient">
A: Don't worry, I'm sure most players won't notice. I've put them all inside the puzzles.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: Or maybe I should just burn them all?

</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: Dude, I hope you've really included some difficult puzzles.
</div>

<div class="line patient">

</div>

<div class="line therapist">
