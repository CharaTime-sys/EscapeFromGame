A: What did those words mean? The isolated island, Satan, etc... To be honest, I didn't quite understand.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: Don't worry about it. It's like planting foreshadowing at the beginning of the story, maybe just the author's reflections on the story.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: The author might even forget about those words at the end, you know, just wanting the reader to be impressed but confused.
</div>

<div class="line patient">
A: That's sophistry. I believe everything has logic.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: That's just your opinion; I'm just saying what comes to mind.
</div>

<div class="line patient">
A: That's so irresponsible! Nobody's going to download our system like that.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: ...

<div class="line patient">
A: ...I think we should talk about something else. I bet someone will answer these questions correctly right away.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: Hmm...can they even guess the math problem correctly? The answer isn't even a number.
</div>

<div class="line patient">
A: Um...that's true.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: But...we could give them a reward...if they get them all right the first time.
</div>

<div class="line patient">
A: You mean this part of the file? I've put them all here: [https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c0wqh9840xkk3xndgh2kf/Devil.zip.001?rlkey=lttuklo0cf00rw5lrk00ws3w8&e=1&st=g0h5cklm&dl=0][https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TjQ1UjaA8zGBJ5TKs_Wd3Q?pwd=tm3v]

<div class="line therapist">
F: No, no, it's something else, like a side ending or something...
</div>

<div class="line patient">
A: Multiple endings? Sounds cool, adding some side endings after the main story is finished.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: Or, the side ending is the main story...nothing...
