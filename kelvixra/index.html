F: You know, "Pony Island" is a really cool game.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: I bet players who've played it are wondering if there's a cheat code for the little dinosaur level.
</div>

<div class="line patient">
A: That's a great idea. Maybe making it a hidden level would be fun.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: Maybe incorporating other classic games in this format would be a good start...
</div>

<div class="line patient">
A: How about Backrooms?
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: Maybe let's save it last, like getting stuck at the end of a chapter... Okay, I think Chapter One is about right.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: Oh, by the way, are you sure you've saved the program correctly?
</div>

<div class="line patient">
A: Of course, just in case, I also backed up the program on two websites.
</div>

<div class="line patient">
A: [Website][Website]
</div>

<div class="line patient">
A: And this is only one part of the compressed file. Even if a player accidentally finds it, they can't unzip it.
</div>

<div class="line therapist">
F: Alright, let's get back to work.
